			<p>Daniel "Danny" Rosario (born January 25, 1973) is a Dominican Operations Support Analyst working for Medidata Solutions. Rosario was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. At the ripe age of 17, Rosario swam across the Atlantic Ocean in hopes of pursuing the American Dream.</p>

			<p>In May 2013, Rosario was involved in a successful relationship. He is happily residing in Hicksville, PA with his girlfriend, step-son, nephew, and a dog named Shiloh. In July 2014, Rosario accompanied his lover to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they adopted their second child, Anthony Quiroz.</p> 

			<p>He aspires that one day, somebody will cheak out his candado (and to grow some hair).</p>
